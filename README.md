========
Latex/Markdown note app.  Lots of things planned for it.

Plan of action
--------------
Rough order for feature implementation

- edit a file and compile it to "TexDown"
- log in and save files to username
- tag files, search files
- fuzzy search files
- generate tags (?)
- select by multiple tags
- publicly share files (ro)
- share privately with users (ro,rw)
- collaborative editing
- download compiled pdf/printer- friendly version
- Dropbox integration
- Google Drive integration
- tutorial
- vim editor option
- autocomplete syntax and underlining/"prettify" source

Throughout, it is important to emphasize a clean, mobile friendly UI (if only for reading on mobile).
