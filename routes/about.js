Teachers and professors expect you to know a lot of stuff and to remember a lot of the things they say. \n\nAnd they don\'t make it easy on you, either: They talk too fast and whiz through slides, so your poor little pen struggles to keep up with their lecture. They expect that you\'re constantly watching what they say and do, which doesn\'t happen when your head is perpetually buried in that notebook on your lap. And of course, sometimes papers get lost, pages get ripped out, and homeworks get bad grades.\n\nOf course, you could always drag your laptop along to class and fire up Word or Google Docs to take notes, but you\'ve always felt that these lacked something that made note-taking clunky and slow.\n\n### TeXDown...\n...is a note-taking app designed with efficiency in mind, which possesses features that provide solutions to many of the pitfalls described above and more. Built with math\x2Fscience\x2Fprogramming classes in mind, TeXDown comes stocked with tons of awesome features that make note-taking a breeze.\n\n## Features\n### Markdown Parsing\nTeXDown\'s main feature is its Markdown [(gfm)](https:\x2F\x2Fhelp.github.com\x2Farticles\x2Fgithub-flavored-markdown) parsing. Write quickly and efficiently with the power of [markdown syntax](http:\x2F\x2Fdaringfireball.net\x2Fprojects\x2Fmarkdown\x2Fbasics\x2F). And so that you don\'t have to check that page every time, you\'ve always got access to a Markdown syntax cheat sheet (try clicking the Markdown button above).\n\n### \\( \\mathrm\\LaTeX \\) Post-Processing\nThis feature is particularly useful for taking efficient notes in math courses. While Markdown is great, neither it nor HTML offer much help in the way of quickly typesetting mathematical expressions. For this reason, we\'ve tacked \\( \\mathrm\\LaTeX \\) processing ontop of gfm so that you can take notes quickly, even in math classes. \n\nAnd just in case you\'re not so quick to remember \\( \\mathrm\\LaTeX \\)\'s syntax or need a little help quickly inserting a complicated math environment, you can do so with the click of a button and keep on typing, or have quick access to some online \\( \\mathrm\\LaTeX \\) resources. Here\'s a beautiful example:\n\n\\[\n 1 + \\frac{q^2}{(1-q)}+\\frac{q^6}{(1-q)(1-q^2)}+\\cdots =\n \\prod_{j=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(1-q^{5j+2})(1-q^{5j+3})},\n \\quad\\quad \\text{for $|q|\x3C1$}.\n\\]\n\n\n### Code Highlighting\nBits are on and off, black and white. \n~~~python\ndef make_it_pretty():\n print \"But code doesn\'t have to be.\"\n~~~\nWhen using TeXDown, simply declare a code block like you would with GFM\'s fenced code blocks and you get wonderfully colored code just like it was meant to be seen.\n\n### `vim` or `emacs` Keybindings\nAre you a guru when it comes to hjkl\'ing around the page? Do `Ctrl` and `Meta` keys make your heart race? Simply set your keybindings in the editor and you\'ll be typing like a pro.\n\n### Autosave and Autocompile\nDon\'t worry about leaving your notebook lying around or forgetting to take a picture of the whiteboard. With TeXDown\'s autosave feature, your notes are always safe and sound so you can get back to owning that class.\n\nFor those visual thinkers out there, there\'s also an auto-compile feature so that what you see is what you\'ve typed. You don\'t even have to click compile.\n\nAlso, coupled with the keybindings feature, you\'ve got even more save and compile options. \n\n\x3Ctable align=\"center\"\x3E\n\t\x3Cthead\x3E\n \t\x3Ctd\x3EAutosave?\x3C\x2Ftd\x3E\n \t\x3Ctd\x3EAutocompile?\x3C\x2Ftd\x3E\n \t\x3Ctd\x3E\x3Ccode\x3E:w\x3C\x2Fcode\x3E\x2F\x3Ccode\x3EC-x C-s\x3C\x2Fcode\x3E...\x3C\x2Ftd\x3E\n \x3C\x2Fthead\x3E\n\t\x3Ctr\x3E\n \t\x3Ctd\x3Eno\x3C\x2Ftd\x3E\n \t\x3Ctd\x3Eno\x3C\x2Ftd\x3E\n \t\x3Ctd\x3Ecompiles\x3C\x2Ftd\x3E\n \x3C\x2Ftr\x3E\n\t\x3Ctr\x3E\n \t\x3Ctd\x3Eno\x3C\x2Ftd\x3E\n \t\x3Ctd\x3Eyes\x3C\x2Ftd\x3E\n \t\x3Ctd\x3Esaves\x3C\x2Ftd\x3E\n \x3C\x2Ftr\x3E\n\t\x3Ctr\x3E\n \t\x3Ctd\x3Eyes\x3C\x2Ftd\x3E\n \t\x3Ctd\x3Eno\x3C\x2Ftd\x3E\n \t\x3Ctd\x3Ecompiles\x3C\x2Ftd\x3E\n \x3C\x2Ftr\x3E\n\t\x3Ctr\x3E\n \t\x3Ctd\x3Eno\x3C\x2Ftd\x3E\n \t\x3Ctd\x3Eno\x3C\x2Ftd\x3E\n \t\x3Ctd\x3Edoes nothing\x3C\x2Ftd\x3E\n \x3C\x2Ftr\x3E\n\x3C\x2Ftable\x3E\n\n## About Us\nHey there! This app was loving made by [Oscar Bezi](http:\x2F\x2Foscarbezi.com) and [Jake Zimmerman](http:\x2F\x2Fjacobzimmerman.me), mostly over the course of Winter Break 2013-2014. After a ton of hard work, it was just ready to enter release beta as the Spring semester is starting. A little bit about the app itself...\n\n### Built with\n---\nTeXDown is a [Node.js] [node] app that is powered by [Express] [express] and hosted on [Heroku] [heroku]. We store data using [MongoDB] [db] through the services provided at [MongoLab] [lab].\n\nRegarding everything you can see, [Bootstrap][boot] is responsible for much of the styling, but [MathJaX][math] takes care of displaying all the beautiful math on the page. The editor and most of the features associated with it come from [CodeMirror] [code], a JavaScript library that provides enough functionality to almost fully mimic even the best IDE. The Markdown is rendered with [marked.js][marked], times are formatted with [moment.js] [moment], and auto(save|compile) are handled with [jQuery-typing][type]. Between all of that, we still needed a few lines of code (unfortunately), so we drew upon our excellent teachings from [Carnegie Mellon University] [cmu].\n\n[node]: http:\x2F\x2Fnodejs.org\x2F\n[express]: http:\x2F\x2Fexpressjs.com\x2F\n[heroku]: https:\x2F\x2Fwww.heroku.com\x2F\n[db]: http:\x2F\x2Fwww.mongodb.org\x2F\n[lab]: https:\x2F\x2Fmongolab.com\x2Fwelcome\x2F\n[boot]: http:\x2F\x2Fgetbootstrap.com\x2F\n[math]: http:\x2F\x2Fwww.mathjax.org\x2F\n[code]: http:\x2F\x2Fcodemirror.net\x2F\n[marked]: https:\x2F\x2Fgithub.com\x2Fchjj\x2Fmarked\n[moment]: http:\x2F\x2Fmomentjs.com\x2F\n[type]: http:\x2F\x2Flab.narf.pl\x2Fjquery-typing\x2F\n[cmu]: http:\x2F\x2Fwww.cmu.edu\x2Findex.shtml\n\n### Development\n---\nWe\'re currently in an open beta, so \x3Cs\x3Esome things\x3C\x2Fs\x3E a lot of things need fixing, and more super awesome features are already in the works! If you see something you think needs fixing, *please* email us at \x3Cadmin@texdown.org\x3E. We\'re also on [Github](https:\x2F\x2Fgithub.com\x2Fbezi\x2Ftexdown) and love pull requests, (especially if you don\'t like the [shade of green](https:\x2F\x2Fgithub.com\x2Fbezi\x2Fcmueats\x2Fpull\x2F1) we use.)\n\n### Great Googly Moogly!\n---\nYou may notice that we use \"Sign in with Google\" for authentication. We\'ve decided that it\'s easier than making a new account for you to remember the credentials for, and it may later lead to fun things with Google Drive integration! \n\nThat said, we do not store any personal information on our servers other than your notes, which are connected to a Google ID number (not an email).\n\n# Seriously though!\nWe hope you enjoy the service! This means we want to know what features you\'d like to see. So seriously, drop us an email or add a feature request on GitHub: we\'d love to hear from you.";
